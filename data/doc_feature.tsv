PUNALUU BLACK SAND BEACH Where: Hawaii Imagine a tropical beach where turquoise water laps up on the shore lined with coconut trees and palm fronds. Now imagine that beach with jet-black sand. That's Punaluu Beach on the southeastern Kau coast in Hawaii. The coastline of this unusual beach is full of rocky outcroppings and reefs. Riptides can be dangerous, so the best way to enjoy Punaluu is by picnicking on the sand. Large groups of sea turtles are common, but don't touch; federal and state laws protect them. PAPAKOLEA BEACH Where: Hawaii Green sand and rocky cliffs make Papakolea Beach seem a bit like an alien landscape. Olivine crystals from the nearby volcanic cone give this beach its olive hue. Intrepid travelers should be prepared for a two-mile hike along rugged sea cliffs to reach this surreal beach on Mahana Bay. Be careful in the water the surf is rough and full of strong currents. PINK SANDS BEACH Where: Harbour Island, Bahamas If black and green beaches aren't for you, then perhaps you'd prefer to lounge on Harbour Island's Pink Sands Beach. One of the island's prettiest beaches features three miles of powdery pink sand. Fancy resorts line this beach, which attracts wealthy vacationers with its calm waters and gorgeous surroundings. BOWLING BALL BEACH Where: Schooner Gulch, CA The sight of the huge, round boulders on the Mendocino Coast might make you wonder if giants really exist. A rare sight, these boulders are surprisingly smooth and lined up like bowling balls. That's not the only odd thing about this beach legend has it Schooner Gulch got its name after a washed-up schooner was spotted in the gulch one night, but there was no sign of it in the morning. GIANT'S CAUSEWAY Where: Northern Ireland Few beaches are more shrouded in mythology than Giant's Causeway. The story goes that the giant Finn MacCool created the hexagonal rock formations as stepping-stones in an attempt to reach his beloved giantess in Scotland. When the giantess's boyfriend fought back, Finn grabbed a chunk of land and flung it toward Scotland, creating the Isle of Man and leaving behind a gaping hole Lough Neagh. The Scottish side of the sea has similar hexagonal structures, supporting the myth. A more scientific explanation maintains that the strange rock formations were created by volcanic eruptions bursting into the sea 60 million years ago. GULPIYURI BEACH Where: Llanes, Spain Can you imagine a tiny beach over 100 meters from the sea? In Llanes, Spain, there is such a place. Gulpiyuri Beach was formed by a sinkhole and is fed by salt water from the Bay of Biscay, which flows in through underground caves. Limestone cliffs and grassy meadows hide this little inland beach, which has become a tourist attraction for people who have to see it to believe it. CHANDIPUR BEACH Where: Bay of Bengal, India Don't bother looking for Chandipur Beach on the Bay of Bengal at low tide you won't find it. Twice a day, the water recedes up to three miles from the shore, leaving long tracts of sand where you can spot horseshoe crabs, seashells, and driftwood. If you hang around for a while, you can watch the sea slowly returning a strange phenomenon to observe. HOT WATER BEACH Where: Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand If you ever wished you could soak in a hot tub right on the beach, Hot Water Beach on Coromandel Peninsula is the place for you. Naturally occurring hot springs bubble up under the sand between high and low tides. For a natural spa-like experience, people dig holes in the sand and lounge in the mineral waters, which reach 150 degrees. GLASS BEACH Where: Fort Bragg, California Colorful sea glass covers the sand at Fort Bragg, glinting brightly in the sunlight. Glass Beach was once a dumping ground, but when that ended in the late 1960s, the sea beautified the area, smoothing the rough edges of broken glass and creating little treasures. You can't swim here, and it's illegal to take the glass, but the beach is still a nice stop along the Mendocino Coast. JURASSIC COAST Where: Dorset and East Devon, England Geologists and fossil hunters travel from far and wide looking for specimens on the Jurassic Coast of England. In addition to the coast's rugged cliffs and coves, 185 million years of the earth's development are on display here. Due to erosion, fossils are continuously being identified, and visitors can go on guided fossil walks. JOKULSARLON Where: Iceland Jökulsárlón can only be described as otherworldly. At this glacial lagoon in southeast Iceland, icebergs float and drift toward the Atlantic. Skua, large predatory sea birds, have made Jökulsárlón their home and can be seen nesting on the black sand. This stunning place was the setting for scenes in the James Bond movies A View to Kill and Die Another Day, as well as Tomb Raider. Don't expect to swim in the freezing waters; you can take a boat tour instead. THUNDER COVE Where: Prince Edward Island, Canada Prince Edward Island near Nova Scotia is full of picturesque beaches, meadows, and farm colonies. Fishermen haul in mussels, oysters, and lobsters from P. E. I.'s shores. What's striking is about half of the beaches have red sand due to high iron oxide content. Thunder Cove is especially surreal and beautiful, with rust-colored sand and dunes. PFEIFFER BEACH Where: Big Sur, CA Big Sur is known for its natural beauty, and Pfeiffer Beach is especially stunning. This hard-to-find beach features purple sand thanks to the manganese garnet found on cliffs by the ocean. The road leading to the beach is unmarked, so keep an eye out for it near Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park on Highway 1. HYAMS BEACH Where: Jervis Bay, Australia Of all the beautiful beaches on Australia's coast, only Hyams Beach holds the Guinness Book of World Records title of the whitest sand. Crystal-clear water, forests, and wetlands only add to Jervis Bay's appeal. Inhabited by Aboriginals for thousands of years, the area boasts important archeological sites, like rock art, stone artifacts, and axe grinding grooves. BOULDERS BEACH Where: Cape Town African penguins waddle along the coast on Boulders Beach, part of Table Mountain National Park. Watch them from the boardwalks (built specifically for penguin-viewing), but stay away from their breeding grounds, as their beaks are razor-sharp and they will bite. The reason for the beach's name is the collection of giant granite boulders weathered down by thousands of years of erosion. All together, the inlets and shady coves provide a unique setting for a vacation.	49	4e4aadcb-4928-0762-e307-bc01ba8f3dfb 5e724283-78a0-d00d-cce4-4f73c28e38b0 e1c6ca8f-9383-4955-a3da-5a8d7bff61ec dea42373-7195-5fc3-7e0b-979075726a83 509a29c0-b412-9be6-71a6-fcd982bf81c8 8639957a-9225-8863-db00-2841b202b152 68611af0-de1c-3b07-e7b5-07fdc70002b6 e454b356-c06d-cdb9-1252-543940e733bf b9cc08a4-c8c2-6244-d021-faca4ba25abc 1fc50400-6eec-1eaf-41c2-5a2078f66f85 10af9e72-db82-2c81-c946-68392842a1f8 f1e1d2c5-279f-4d98-e386-b0a4d8bbf723 954e5903-c6ed-e12c-9ab4-e28b318408ba f2afd711-9e84-1f05-189a-d5be24cbe29d 69051d4a-065b-9501-7a7d-b9328563d61d a41978c2-04d1-62ed-c9fd-b7358ee230ac 52d45af1-981a-5447-0f0b-91acc88533e9 966d8dbd-fd5b-a683-7e55-b09f15b36f18 d4cdd8ea-bedd-d675-8bd0-5715532805e6 6e00cfc6-bf44-6afb-16d9-7e25203bf84c b6f01eaf-aecf-44f6-b64d-1f6e982365c3 a30799d3-8fda-555a-d6c4-49eb63f3b934 e1ba31bc-7b8e-2e19-cd94-e86fc0852594 3009d91d-d582-4c34-85ba-772ba09e5be1 b211c7c6-3a25-4cd1-dd77-cb3bcd5816c1 1baf9d59-f443-e9f4-6e49-de048a073e3f 06de2191-243d-a83f-6990-2eb1c7f3382a b8ce484d-56cf-dae9-e300-b090ff0cb183 c291073f-e491-26da-ccef-153f8bde727f cc33fb0f-11af-0f77-4d33-216c57f0cc9c baa4aedd-bbb6-989e-cba4-ec2c9bdd906a 27f36c28-9ec9-d220-72cc-2e590b20f82b 90681bdd-56bd-f793-bb74-ad2d7e6a3f6d 1b58b366-94ee-a2a7-2694-0c4a4afeafab ed35e351-c1a9-3b17-cbf5-0cd565ce2ba1 7b697b98-32b8-e51c-db93-8ecf9879dae0 11626d6a-6cdf-ce54-7496-3f26a7d1e126 cf935ada-9b21-2163-8f35-fd2d0748aa37 38c51a4c-68bd-eab9-a730-4ad2c9c282b1 09f3da7f-111d-fcd0-61c6-4171ea599648 e4b8bc44-385c-e87b-bb7d-b32328f53502 6517d967-9362-4c0d-83d2-cf369fa5fcda 85fa63d3-9596-adb9-b4eb-502273d84f56
AA1FoBv	travel	pointofinterestbrowse	America's Best Small Towns	For the second year in a row, we've compiled a list that highlights some of the best places in the country you don't hear about every day. For the second year in a row, we've compiled a list that highlights some of the best places in the country you don't hear about every day. Telluride, Colorado Population: 2,291 Formerly a mining town, Telluride offers a unique way to experience Colorado's mountains, replete with small-town charm that many other major ski areas lack. The town has a storied history Telluride was the site of Butch Cassidy's first major recorded crime in 1889 and Victorian storefronts and frontier-era facades still adorn the compact downtown area. Today, the town is an all-season resort, with world-class skiing at nearby Mountain Village and mountain biking, hiking, and almost every outdoor sport imaginable in the summer. The annual bluegrass festival in June and film festival in August are two of Telluride's biggest summer draws, though the 4th of July celebration is a local favorite. Proudly boasting no chain restaurants or shops, the town has seen its fair share of celebrity guests in its history, but still maintains its untainted, small-town allure. For a truly Colorado experience, take the St. Sophia gondola to the top of the mountain for breathtaking views and exquisite food at Allred's. Where to Stay: Largely due to its celebrity clientele, Telluride has an extensive line-up of luxury hotels, particularly for a town that doesn't have a stoplight. A self-described "adventure boutique hotel," Lumiere is one of the town's premiere lodgings. For a more budget-friendly option, try the New Sheridan Hotel and indulge in its rooftop hot tubs. Beaufort, South Carolina Population: 12,788 Not to be confused with its North Carolinian namesake, Beaufort (pronounced byoo-fort) has everything you would hope for in a small Southern town: antebellum mansions, Spanish-moss-covered trees, and a picturesque seaside location on Port Royal Island. What makes Beaufort unique is the local Gullah culture, which traces its roots back to the African rice-coast and can still be seen in the town's culture, food, and local language. Beaufort also offers access to a plethora of water sports, so set aside some time to enjoy South Carolina's notoriously warm waters in addition to your perusal of the town's history. For the freshest seafood, head to Saltus River Grill to enjoy their decadent raw bar and watch the sunset from the outdoor patio. Be sure to pick up a locally made sweetgrass basket before you leave, one of South Carolina's traditional crafts. Where to Stay: The nearly 200-year-old home-turned-hotel at The Rhett House Inn makes for a classically Southern experience, with antiques bedecking the beautifully maintained historical building. Breakfast, afternoon tea, evening hors d'oeuvres, and dessert are included in the price, and don't miss the opportunity to enjoy a meal on the wrap-around porch. Marfa, Texas Population: 1,899 Marfa is perhaps best known for its quirky art installations, but there's a lot more to love about this artists' haven in southwestern Texas. The downtown area is still dotted with historic architecture, in which you'll find several modern art galleries that give the town its reputation. The most famous of the town's collections is held at the Chinati Foundation, founded by artist Donald Judd, who moved to Marfa in 1971 and put the town on the international art scene. Marfa is still known today for its world-class collection of minimalist art, which mimics the surrounding Texas landscape. Another reason to stop here is to see the famous Marfa Lights. This phenomenon, in which lights appear hovering over the horizon, has been attributed to car headlights or small fires, but has gained something of a cult following due to the lights' spooky appearance. Marfa is also home to some excellent dining options; stop into Maiya's for an eclectic menu, or opt for a casual bite at Food Shark, a Mediterranean food truck. Where to Stay: When in Marfa, it's best to embrace the town's quirks, and perhaps nothing is as pleasantly odd as El Cosmico, a collection of Airstream RVs, yurts, tepees, and tents that offers a unique glamping experience. If you're looking for more traditional lodgings, try the Thunderbird Hotel, a 1950s converted motel along the town's main drag. Paia, Hawaii Population: 2,668 It can be difficult to find remnants of authentic Hawaii behind the multitude of resorts, but this is one of the last holdouts. Located on Maui's northern coast just off highway 36, Paia was founded as a sugarcane enclave and though the sugar mill closed in 2000, the town is as alive as ever. Boutiques featuring everything from high-end fashion to beachwear line the streets, and with some of the world's best windsurfing spots in the area, you're sure to find an opportunity to put your new gear to good use. Because it sits along the route to Hana, the town is pleasantly devoid of major resorts and offers a great stopping-off place for a few hours or a few days. While in the area, explore Hookipa Beach, where you're sure to see a bevy of windsurfers. Café des Amis and Café Mambo serve up eclectic Mediterranean dishes and both offer excellent people watching along Baldwin Avenue. Where to Stay: The Paia Inn along the Hana Highway features private beach access, a rooftop patio and a surprisingly quiet ambiance despite being its location on one of the town's bustling thoroughfares. Calistoga, California Population: 5,208 Calistoga may not have the posh atmosphere of neighboring St. Helena or Healdsburg, but what it lacks in glamour it makes up for in character (and bargain prices). The Western-style shops along Lincoln Avenue, the town's main street, lend Calistoga a down-home frontier feel not usually found in the highly refined Napa Valley. In addition to its prime location in California's wine country (particularly near Schramsberg Vineyards), Calistoga is also home to historic hot springs and a mini geothermal geyser known as "Little Old Faithful." The town has outlawed fast-food franchises, ensuring that Calistoga retains its authentic charm. Nearby Castello di Amorosa, a winery modeled after a medieval castle, makes for an interesting visit, but don't leave town without stopping into Solbar, renowned chef Brandon Sharps' eatery located at the Solage resort. Where to Stay: For those looking to luxuriate, the Solage Calistoga is a great option, complete with the eco-conscious Solage Spa. Or try the cedar-shingled Calistoga Ranch, which seamlessly blends indoor and outdoor spaces.e Port Townsend, Washington Population: 9,117 Tucked away in the northeastern tip of the Olympic Peninsula, this Victorian seaport is distinguished by its maritime history, quirky spirit, and touch of urban chic. A popular weekend destination for Seattle residents and other Washingtonians, PT (as locals call it) entices visitors with its active arts scene, gallery- and boutique-lined main street, unique festivals, and outdoor activities including whale watching and kayaking in Fort Worden State Park. Despite its small size, Port Townsend is home to a sophisticated set of writers, artists, and musicians, so you'll find an eclectic range of shops and restaurants here. Alchemy Bistro & Wine Bar and Fins Coastal Cuisine are the best places for fresh Pacific Northwest salmon and oysters, while Fountain Café and Khu Larb Thai are popular for international fare. Be sure to explore the many shops on Water and Washington Streets, parallel to the bay, including a stop at the Port Townsend Antique Mall, where you can find high-end Victorian collectors' items. Where to Stay: For a taste of Victorian elegance, check into the Ann Starett Mansion or the Old Consulate Inn. The former pairs original details with slightly more modern furnishings, while the latter is truly a throwback experience, with innkeepers who dress in period costume. Stockbridge, Massachusetts Population: 1,947 Serving as the inspiration for Normal Rockwell's depictions of Americana on the front page of the Saturday Evening Post, Stockbridge is truly the paradigm of a small New England town. The artist lived in this undeveloped gem in the Berkshires from 1953 until 1978, capturing Stockbridge's unique character in his paintings. Today, you can visit the Norman Rockwell Museum to see a retrospective of his work; also tour Chesterwood, sculptor Daniel Chester French's summer home. In many ways, Stockbridge feels timeless with its well-preserved architecture from the 18th and 19th centuries, which explains why this has long been a destination for wealthy Bostonians looking for a country escape. What's more, Rockwell wasn't the only artist to be inspired by this Massachusetts town; Stockbridge has been immortalized in James Taylor's "Sweet Baby James," and in Arlo Guthrie's classic, droll Thanksgiving monologue-ballad "Alice's Restaurant." The town is also home to an eclectic shopping scene and Rouge, a French bistro housed in a shingled cottage just outside of town. Where to Stay: The Inn at Stockbridge has beautiful grounds, but its proximity to the highway means some rooms are less quiet than others. The Red Lion Inn has been in operation since 1773 and consists of one historic building and nine annexes, each one unique. Cooperstown, New York Population: 1,833 Founded in 1786, this town is filled with stately homes and civic structures but you probably know it best as the location of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Cooperstown isn't just a destination for sports lovers, with cultural attractions including the Cooperstown Chamber Music Festival, the annual Glimmerglass Opera season, and the Fenimore Art Museum. Outdoorsy types, meanwhile, can enjoy golfing at Leatherstocking Golf Course, boating on Otsego Lake, and hiking in Glimmerglass State Park. Beer lovers shouldn't pass up a chance to tour the esteemed Brewery Ommegang, which produces Belgian-style brews and hosts a Belgian food-and-drink festival on its grounds every August. For dining, highlights include the global-inspired menu at Alex & Ika Restaurant and the waterfront views at Lake Front Restaurant. Where to Stay: For grandeur on the waterfront, there's no better option than the elegant Otesaga Resort Hotel. Ashland, Oregon Population: 20,366 Though it's home to the largest population on our list, Ashland is hardly lacking in small-town charm: Picture twisting hillside streets lined with Victorian homes, a town center with a stream running through it, and a gorgeous 93-acre park. Best known as the home of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, which attracts more than 100,000 theatergoers annually, Ashland has year-round appeal thanks to its outdoor activities, cultural offerings, and growing status as a culinary destination. If Shakespeare's not your thing, check out the Schneider Museum of Art, which showcases local artists as well as notables such as Alexander Calder and George Inness. In warmer weather, there are great options for biking, fishing, and whitewater rafting; in winter, the 23 trails at Mt. Ashland Ski Area get more than 280 inches of snow every season. While in town, make a reservation for dinner at locally celebrated Amuse, which serves French cuisine driven by local, seasonal ingredients. Where to Stay: Of Ashland's many upscale B&Bs, the intimate Chanticleer Inn stands out for rooms that all have expansive views of the Chanticleer Mountains. Plus, they only stock eco-friendly products. Bardstown, Kentucky Population: 12,848 For a stopover in Kentucky bourbon country, it's hard to beat Bardstown, where it's easy to be charmed by the Georgian architecture and local hospitality. With a nostalgia-inducing Main Street, featuring a historic courthouse and an old-fashioned soda fountain, Kentucky's second-oldest town retains its historic splendor. Here you'll find My Old Kentucky Home State Park, said to have inspired Stephen Foster when he penned the state song of the same name. The downtown area has been recognized by the National Register of Historic Places, and a Civil War Museum, Museum of Whiskey, and a packed events calendar round out the offerings in Bardstown, named the Most Beautiful Small Town in America in 2012. Though a visit to the several distilleries in the area (including Jim Beam and Maker's Mark) will likely top your list of things to do, don't leave town without stopping into Old Tabbott Tavern, in continuous operation since 1779. Where to Stay: While in town, opt for a night or two at one of the many charming B&Bs.

BBSrviu	sports	basketball_nba	Luke Walton has 'loved' the way the young Lakers have been developing and watching film more	Luke Walton has enjoyed watching the Lakers learn from their mistakes and develop. With a win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday, the Los Angeles Lakers improved to 5-7 without LeBron James. While that might not sound all that impressive   because it really isn't   it's the best any team has done without James for the greater half of this decade. In the 27 regular season games the Cleveland Cavaliers played without James from 2014 to 2018, the Cavs went 4-23. Both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were available for 17 of those games. The Lakers don't have an Irving or a Love , but they do have an exciting collection of young talent that has been working tirelessly to try and prove they can compete now, not later. In an interview with Sam Amick of The Athletic , Lakers head coach Luke Walton said he's enjoying the process of watching the young guys grow up on the fly: "With the young guys, I love watching them figure stuff out. You work on things, and watching them grow as players, watching them go from young men coming into the league where life's about one thing and it's nice to have some money and it's nice to do whatever, and then flip that switch where they're texting me clips at night of 'Hey, what should we have done differently with this defensive play?" This backs up just about everything we've heard from the veterans in the locker room this season. In October, Rajon Rondo said he has never been around a team that is as dedicated to watching film as the Lakers are. "I love our young guys and their commitment, the way they study the game, their willingness to learn," Rondo said. "I was telling 'Bron today, we were on the plane and I've never seen damn near 12 guys watching film as a team. I haven't seen that many guys combined in my last four or five seasons out there as a team. It was very refreshing to see and understand this team and its commitment." To Rondo 's credit, he's been a big part of that culture shift . There might be teams with more raw, young talent than the Lakers around the league, but their obsession with wanting to improve is what's going to set them apart from the rest. Let's hope is starts translating to more wins sooner rather than later. For more Lakers talk, subscribe to the Silver Screen and Roll podcast feed on iTunes , Spotify , Stitcher or Google Podcasts .

BBSrvsi	sports	basketball_nba	Spurs win close one without DeRozan	MINNEAPOLIS   Timberwolves guard Josh Okogie arrived at the Target Center well prepared for the unenviable task of trying to defend leading Spurs scorer and playmaker DeMar DeRozan. "He has a lot of pump fakes when he comes off pick and rolls," Okogie said. "He likes to swing through with his arms extended to draw fouls. For me, I have to stay solid, stay on the ground, don't jump until he jumps." Fortunately for Okogie, he didn't have to face the four-time All-Star after all. But that doesn't mean the Timberwolves didn't have other tough matchups to deal with Friday night. LaMarcus Aldridge had 25 points and Rudy Gay added 22 to lead the Spurs to a hard-fought 116-113 victory in their first game this season without DeRozan. Aldridge scored six points in the fourth quarter, including a turnaround jumper with 1:23 left that gave the Spurs a 112-107 lead with 1:23 left. Gay also had a clutch shot late, sinking a baseline jumper with 36.8 seconds left to give the Spurs a 114-111 cushion. Derrick Rose answered that shot with a driving layup with 29 seconds left, but the Timberwolves lost a loose ball out of bounds after Marco Belinelli missed a jumper with 6 seconds to go. Belinelli sank a pair of free throws with 4.2 left for the final margin. The game ended with Rose missing a double-clutch 3-point attempt while defended by Davis Bertans. DeRozan was a late scratch with a sore left ankle. A Spurs spokesperson said he tweaked his ankle in Wednesday's 105-101 victory at Dallas. In winning their second in a row and eighth in the past 11, the Spurs (27-20) had four other players finish in double figures: Derrick White (15), Belinelli (15), Bertans (11) and Bryn Forbes (10). Karl-Anthony Towns and Rose each scored 23 for the Timberwolves (21-24). The Spurs led by seven points twice in the third quarter, with their second cushion by that margin coming after White drained a 3-pointer with 4:17. Towns played sparingly in the third quarter after picking up his fourth foul with 10:25 left, but the Spurs couldn't take advantage as Minnesota went up by 10 midway through the third. The Spurs fought back with a 12-2 run sparked by Gay, who scored seven points in the period. DeRozan's injury comes in the midst of a tough month for him. He finished December averaging 22.9 points per game while shooting 47.7 percent from the field and 83.7 percent from the free-throw line. But in eight games in January, he's averaging 16.3 points while shooting 40.8 percent from the field and 72.7 percent from the free-throw line, his lowest numbers for any month this season. DeRozan said after Wednesday's game that fatigue wasn't a factor in his slump, pointing instead to the natural ebbs and flows of the long NBA season. January historically also has been a tough month for him shooting-wise. "I pride myself on trying to go out there and play every single game," DeRozan said. "Sometimes you get to that halfway mark and it's natural that you hit some type of dip." The Timberwolves have had injury issues of their own. Forward Robert Covington has missed the past eight games with a bone bruise in his right knee. Minnesota also played without guard Tyus Jones, who sprained his left ankle in a 149-107 loss at Philadelphia on Tuesday. The Timberwolves came into the game determined to play with an edge after the embarrassment at the hands of former teammate Jimmy Butler and the Sixers. The first half ended knotted at 58-58 after 19 lead changes and 11 ties. Neither team shot above 43 percent, and they both committed six turnovers. Belinelli finished the first half with 13 points. White had 12, and Aldridge went into the locker room with 11 after missing 6 of 8 shots from the field. Towns had 14 for Minnesota, while Wiggins and Gibson scored 12 each. torsborn@express-news.net	25	58055d58-dde7-6ea2-a468-d8911894a9f5 45cc6ff2-78a3-b0c6-fe35-5b6045fd0088 63b81a1e-8bae-dc17-39cb-46ef99d36c78 bfcb1289-8397-5aef-dc0e-adecc59c39af 5e534429-b3a2-9174-8b42-f961c80f3867 a621ffe6-1ee5-666b-5f98-af15ef846b75 0e165eed-087b-4494-bc17-a3c03a686053 ab8bd69d-2a69-217e-7e93-6700fc3d67c7 49aaca16-29b4-499c-8b0a-3a2b04b4a565 38b034b2-a308-45ee-8a26-dcbeac8f2bf4 5d76ecf6-4738-d1f1-d61e-7519604d2f8a 6a663a6a-b921-4350-b346-27f852c5cbba f71dee19-5a83-915f-0c3f-2942deae0752 b5293f9d-d9ab-27b1-c8d1-2f9531ad0bed 5ada59c0-d6a8-11bb-8542-4ba618cf0c8d

DeRozan was a late scratch with a sore left ankle. A Spurs spokesperson said he tweaked his ankle in Wednesday's 105-101 victory at Dallas. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said DeRozan likely will return against the Clippers on Sunday at the AT&T Center. "He has a lot of bumps and bruises," Popovich said. "He came in stiff tonight. His thigh has been hurting and his ankle. He has been playing a lot of minutes, more than most people, and it seemed better to let his body recover tonight." Aldridge scored six points in the fourth quarter, including a turnaround jumper with 1:23 left that gave the Spurs a 112-107 lead with 1:23 left. Gay also had a clutch shot late, sinking a jumper from the corner with 36.8 seconds left to give the Spurs a 114-111 cushion.
